# Do and Don’t Guidelines

This document provides practical guidance on producing clear, professional and accessible visualisations within the Health Economics Unit.

These examples reflect common issues seen in analytical outputs and how to improve them.

---

## 1. Titles

### ✅ Do
- Use titles that communicate the key message.
- Include time period and population where relevant.

Example:
> Emergency admission rates increased in 2023 compared to 2022 (rate per 100,000)

### ❌ Don’t
- Use generic titles such as:
  > Emergency Admissions

The title should help the audience understand the takeaway.

---

## 2. Axes and scales

### ✅ Do
- Include units on all axes.
- Use consistent scales when comparing charts.
- Clearly label truncated axes if used.

### ❌ Don’t
- Truncate axes without explanation.
- Mix percentage and absolute values without clear labelling.
- Use dual axes unless absolutely necessary.

Dual axes should generally be avoided as they can mislead interpretation.

---

## 3. Colour usage

### ✅ Do
- Use a consistent, colour-blind safe palette.
- Use colour intentionally to highlight key information.
- Use greys for secondary or contextual data.

### ❌ Don’t
- Use bright or saturated colours for all elements.
- Rely solely on red/green contrasts.
- Change colour meaning across charts in the same report.

Colour should support interpretation, not distract from it.

---

## 4. Legends and labelling

### ✅ Do
- Use direct labels where possible.
- Keep legends simple and clearly positioned.
- Label lines at the end of the series for time trends.

### ❌ Don’t
- Force the reader to cross-reference distant legends.
- Overcrowd charts with unnecessary annotations.
- Use unexplained acronyms.

Reduce cognitive load wherever possible.

---

## 5. Chart selection

### ✅ Do
- Match the chart type to the analytical question.
- Use line charts for trends.
- Use funnel plots for variation analysis.
- Use distribution plots for model outputs.

### ❌ Don’t
- Use pie charts for complex comparisons.
- Use stacked bar charts when comparing precise values.
- Default to bar charts for time series data.

Choose the simplest chart that answers the question.

---

## 6. Showing uncertainty

### ✅ Do
- Include confidence intervals where relevant.
- Use light shading for uncertainty bands.
- Clearly explain what the interval represents.

### ❌ Don’t
- Present modelled estimates without uncertainty.
- Overload charts with multiple overlapping interval types.
- Leave uncertainty unexplained.

Uncertainty is a strength of analytical work, not a weakness.

---

## 7. Complexity

### ✅ Do
- Break complex visuals into multiple simpler charts.
- Use small multiples where appropriate.
- Focus each chart on one core message.

### ❌ Don’t
- Combine too many metrics into one visual.
- Overcrowd slides.
- Attempt to answer multiple questions in one chart.

If it takes more than 30 seconds to interpret, simplify.

---

## 8. Professional presentation

### ✅ Do
- Maintain consistent formatting across a report.
- Use the HEU visualisation templates.
- Ensure visuals are readable when projected.

### ❌ Don’t
- Mix multiple font styles.
- Use inconsistent date formats.
- Leave placeholder text or default styling.

Consistency builds credibility.

These guidelines should be applied alongside the principles and accessibility standards in this repository.
