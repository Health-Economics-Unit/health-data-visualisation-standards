# Chart Types Guidance

Selecting the correct chart type is critical to clear communication.  
The visual should match the analytical question being asked.

This document provides guidance on recommended chart types for common Health Economics Unit analyses.

## 1. Trends Over Time

### Use:
- Line charts
- Rolling average overlays (where appropriate)
- Confidence bands for uncertainty

### Suitable for:
- Admission rates
- Referral volumes
- Waiting times
- Mortality rates
- Model forecasts

### Good practice:
- Clearly state time window (e.g. Jan 2019–Dec 2023)
- Use consistent time intervals
- Avoid overly dense tick marks
- Use subtle uncertainty shading

Avoid:
- Bar charts for long time series
- Overlapping multiple trend lines without clear distinction

---

## 2. Comparing Groups

### Use:
- Dot plots (preferred for clarity)
- Bar charts (for simple comparisons)
- Small multiples for subgroup analysis

### Suitable for:
- ICS comparisons
- Demographic breakdowns
- Intervention vs comparator
- Scenario comparisons

### Good practice:
- Order categories logically (e.g. highest to lowest)
- Clearly label units
- Use consistent scales when showing multiple charts

Avoid:
- Pie charts for multi-category comparisons
- Overcrowded stacked bars

---

## 3. Distribution of Values

### Use:
- Histograms
- Density plots
- Boxplots
- Violin plots

### Suitable for:
- Cost distributions
- Length of stay
- Model output distributions
- PSA simulations

### Good practice:
- Label axes clearly (including units)
- Consider log scales for skewed cost data
- Explain what summary statistics represent

Avoid:
- Reporting only means for highly skewed data
- Overlapping too many distributions in one chart

---

## 4. Variation Across Organisations

### Use:
- Funnel plots (preferred)
- Control charts (where appropriate)

### Suitable for:
- Provider variation
- Outcome rates
- Performance benchmarking

### Good practice:
- Include control limits (95%, 99.8%)
- Clearly state denominator and case-mix adjustments
- Label outliers appropriately

Avoid:
- Ranking organisations without context
- Using raw rates without adjustment

---

## 5. Survival and Time-to-Event Analysis

### Use:
- Kaplan–Meier curves
- Cumulative incidence plots (where relevant)

### Suitable for:
- Time to diagnosis
- Time to treatment
- Overall survival
- Progression-free survival

### Good practice:
- Include number at risk tables
- Clearly define censoring
- Use confidence intervals where appropriate

Avoid:
- Presenting survival without time scale clarity
- Overlapping too many strata without clear differentiation

--- 

## 6. Forecasting and Scenario Modelling

### Use:
- Line charts with prediction intervals
- Scenario comparison charts

### Suitable for:
- Demand modelling
- Capacity modelling
- Service planning
- Policy impact modelling

### Good practice:
- Clearly distinguish historical vs forecast data
- Use shading or line styles to differentiate scenarios
- State model assumptions in accompanying text

Avoid:
- Presenting forecasts without uncertainty
- Mixing historical and forecast data without visual separation

When selecting a chart type, ask:

- What question is this visual answering?
- What decision does this support?
- Who is the audience?
- Does this chart reduce or increase cognitive load?

The simplest chart that answers the question clearly is usually the best choice.
