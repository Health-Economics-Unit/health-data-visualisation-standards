# Accessibility Standards

The Health Economics Unit is committed to producing analytical outputs that are accessible, inclusive and usable by a wide range of audiences.

Accessibility is not an optional enhancement — it is a core requirement of public sector communication.

This document defines minimum accessibility standards for data visualisation.

## 1. Colour accessibility

### Use colour-blind safe palettes

- Avoid relying solely on red/green distinctions.
- Use palettes that remain distinguishable under common forms of colour vision deficiency.
- Where possible, test charts using colour-blind simulators.

### Do not rely on colour alone

Colour should not be the only way information is conveyed.

Use:
- Line styles (solid, dashed, dotted)
- Marker shapes
- Direct labels
- Annotations

---

## 2. Contrast and readability

- Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background.
- Avoid light grey text on white backgrounds.
- Avoid low-contrast colour combinations.
- Ensure printed versions remain readable in greyscale where possible.

Minimum standards:
- Clear axis labels
- Legible tick labels
- Titles readable when projected in a meeting room

---

## 3. Font size guidance

For slide decks:
- Titles: minimum 20–24pt equivalent
- Axis labels: minimum 16–18pt equivalent
- Avoid overcrowding with small annotations

For reports:
- Maintain readability when printed.
- Avoid excessively small legends or footnotes.

---

## 4. Clear labelling

Prefer direct labelling over legends where possible.

- Label lines directly at the end of the series.
- Clearly state units (%, rate per 100,000, £, QALYs).
- Include time periods and denominators.
- Avoid unexplained acronyms.

Clarity reduces cognitive load and improves accessibility for all users.

---

## 5. Layout and cognitive load

- Avoid overcrowded charts.
- Limit the number of categories shown at once.
- Break complex visuals into multiple charts where needed.
- Use whitespace intentionally.

If a chart requires extensive explanation, reconsider the design.

---

## 6. Uncertainty presentation

Uncertainty should be visible but not overwhelming.

- Use subtle confidence bands rather than heavy shading.
- Ensure uncertainty intervals are distinguishable in greyscale.
- Clearly explain what the uncertainty represents.

---

## 7. Accessibility for public dissemination

When outputs are published externally:

- Ensure compliance with NHS accessibility standards. https://www.england.nhs.uk/long-read/accessible-information-standard-requirements-dapb1605/
- Provide alt text descriptions where appropriate.
- Avoid embedding critical information only in images.
- Ensure PDFs are accessible where possible.

---

## 8. Testing checklist

Before finalising a visual:

- Is it readable from the back of a meeting room?
- Is it interpretable in greyscale?
- Is colour the only distinguishing feature?
- Are units and timeframes clearly labelled?
- Would a non-technical stakeholder understand the message?

Accessibility improves clarity for everyone — not just those with specific needs.
