# Health Economics Unit — Data Visualisation Standards

This repository defines the Health Economics Unit’s standards for producing clear, consistent and accessible data visualisations across our analytical work.  
It includes written guidance and ready-to-use templates for **Python (matplotlib)** and **R (ggplot2)**.

## What’s in this repo

- **Standards**: principles, chart guidance, uncertainty, accessibility, and do/don’t examples
- **Templates**:
  - Python: a matplotlib style file and helper functions
  - R: a ggplot2 theme and example gallery
- **Governance**: publishing checklist to support safe and consistent sharing

## Quick start

### Python (matplotlib)
tbc
### R
tbc

## Principles (short version)

- Prioritise **clarity and interpretability** over decoration.
- Use **direct labelling** and include **units and time windows**.
- Where appropriate, show **uncertainty** (CI, IQR, PSA, scenario ranges).
- Ensure outputs are **accessible** (colour-blind safe, readable font sizes).
- Use consistent formatting across charts in a report or slide deck.
